### Designing the Optimal Employee Experience... For Employers

##### Joey Maalouf

Using a dataset published by Medium on Kaggle, I explored the relationship between an employee's working conditions and the likelihood that they will quit their job. There were some expected trends, like lower salary leading to a higher attrition rate, but also some surprising ones, like having an accident at work leading to a lower likelihood of quitting! This observed information can be used by employers to determine the quitting probability of a specific individual, or to calculate the attrition rate of a larger group, like a department, and adjust their conditions accordingly.
